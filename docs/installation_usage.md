# Installation & Usage

**There is no simple installation process for end users!**  
This is mostly intended for python developers  
Only tested OS is linux, might work on Windows (after fixing torch cuda deps and
converting `bin/run.sh` to `bin/run.bat`, make PR if you want to fix windows)


You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)  
Clone repo  
Download blob of model weights from latest release into `models/` directory  
```wget https://github.com/Saegl/dinora/releases/download/v0.2.2/alphanet_classic.ckpt```  

run ```$ uv run python -m dinora```  
After dependencies downloaded this will run [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface)  
To check that everything works, in UCI repl you could type  
```uci``` - Will show available options  
```go``` - Will start infinite search and print moves, cancel with `Ctrl-C`  

## Engine options

Options are searcher specific, `--help` documents the ones the engine
accepts, with their defaults and ranges  
```$ uv run python -m dinora --help```  
```$ uv run python -m dinora --searcher ext_mcts --help```  

In a GUI they are sent as `setoption name <name> value <value>`

Additionally, you can check that cuda works
```
$ uv run python
>>> import torch
>>> torch.cuda.is_available() # Should be true
```  

If you have any problems during installation open issue  

## GUI

Install any UCI compatible chess GUI program.
I personally recommend [CuteChess](https://cutechess.com/) from
[releases](https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess/releases)

To configure Dinora chess engine in CuteChess,  
browse Tools > Settings > Engines > Add a new engine >
