### Warning  
The dataset **`saegl/dinora-chess/traindocs:v0`** mentioned in this documentation is **deprecated**.  

Using it will **silently fail to train**.  

To proceed, **create a new dataset** or **checkout to GitHub tag `v0.2.3`** for a working version.  
This documentation will be updated in the next release.  

# Training

For training you need [wandb account](https://wandb.ai), to store various
artifacts (datasets, weights, graphs). Fully local training is not supported

Also, you need access to Nvidia GPU

Training is 3 steps:
1. Dataset preprocessing
2. Neural network training on GPU
3. Chess engines minimatch to evaluate strength


## Dataset

To start training you need games dataset, preprocessed to `compact dataset`
(numpy arrays) and uploaded to wandb. You have two options:


### Option 1: Use Preprocessed Dataset

[Take one of my datasets](https://wandb.ai/saegl/dinora-chess/artifacts/dataset/traindocs/v0).
To take my dataset you need a wandb label for now,
like "saegl/dinora-chess/traindocs:v0", that will be placed in training config later.


### Option 2: Create a New dataset

(Skip this step if you took my label)  

For this step you need spare computer for a lot of time, no GPU needed at this
point, cheap VPS or old computer is enough.
To create dataset you need [PGN files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation).

You can take them from these places
- [Lichess Database](https://database.lichess.org/): Games played on lichess.org between
  humans
- [Lichess Elite](https://database.nikonoel.fr/): Games from lichess players but
  filtered to contain only (2400 vs 2200 Elo)
- [Leela Standard Dataset](https://lczero.org/blog/2018/09/a-standard-dataset/):
  Chess analog to MNIST, 2.5M games between chess engines
- Or any other PGN file with at least 100k games

Before training PGN need to be converted to numpy arrays.  

Prepare folder of PGNs like this:
```
example_dataset/1.pgn
example_dataset/2.pgn
example_dataset/3.pgn
...
```

You can use any name instead of `example_dataset`. Each pgn should have about 10k
games. Existing PGN tools will help, for example:

Let's take games from Lichess Elite


```bash
wget https://database.nikonoel.fr/lichess_elite_2022-04.zip
unzip lichess_elite_2022-04.zip
# Now we have single lichess_elite_2022-04.zip with 339k games

# Download pgn-extract to split this file
# Check for newer versions here https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/djb/pgn-extract/
wget https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/~djb/pgn-extract/pgn-extract-25-01.zip
unzip pgn-extract-25-01.zip
cd pgn-extract-25-01.zip
make
cd ..

mkdir example_dataset
cd example_dataset
# Split to 1.pgn 2.pgn ... each 10k games
../pgn-extract/pgn-extract ../lichess_elite_2022-04.pgn -#10000

# I actually included only {1..16}.pgn for this example
# rm {17..34}.pgn
cd ..
```

Once you have this `example_dataset` folder of PGNs, convert it to numpy arrays
and upload to wandb

```bash
mkdir dataset_np
# Took 40 minutes on my computer, 186MB of disk space
uv run python -m dataset make example_dataset/ dataset_np/ --q-nodes 100

# login to wandb first
wandb login
# Upload dataset to wandb
uv run python -m dataset upload dataset_np/ "traindocs"

# In my case, uploaded to "saegl/dinora-chess/traindocs:v0" wandb label
```

## Train

For this step you need Nvidia GPU. You can train from terminal or jupyter
notebook. In both cases progress will be tracked by wandb.

### Prepare config

Example configs are in `configs/train/` folder

Annotated example below (don't include comments in actual config)  
Or read `src/train/fit.py`
```jsonc
{
    "matmul_precision": "medium",
    "max_time": null,
    "max_epochs": -1,
    // wandb dataset label mentioned before
    "dataset_label": "saegl/dinora-chess/traindocs:v0",
    // position evaluation is combination of z and q
    "z_weight": 0.0, // Train from game outcome
    "q_weight": 1.0, // Train from Stockfish annotations

    "tune_batch": true, // Search for max batch before training
    "batch_size": 512, // overwritten in this case

    "tune_learning_rate": true, // Search for best lr
    "learning_rate": 0.6918309709189363, // overwritten in this case
    "lr_scheduler_gamma": 1.0, // lr decay, here is no effect (multiple by 1)
    "lr_scheduler_freq": 30000,

    // pytorch lightning checkpointing, was broken last time I check
    // use `enable_validation_checkpointer` below
    "enable_checkpointing": true,
    "checkpoint_train_time_interval": {"minutes": 30},

    // Those will render nice stats in wandb
    "enable_sample_game_generator": true,
    "enable_boards_evaluator": true,
    "enable_validation_checkpointer": true,

    "log_every_n_steps": 100,

    // Run validation 2 times in epoch, since epochs are usually huge
    "val_check_interval": 0.5,

    "limit_train_batches": null,
    "limit_val_batches": null,
    "limit_test_batches": null,

    // hyperparams of model
    "model_type": "alphanet",

    "res_channels": 256,
    "res_blocks": 19,
    "policy_channels": 64,
    "value_channels": 8,
    "value_lin_channels": 256
}
```

### Option 1: From terminal

```bash
uv run python -m train.fit <path-to-config>
```

### Option 2: From jupyter notebook

This is useful when you want to run in services like Google Colab / Kaggle /
Vast.ai. They have jupyter notebooks with `torch` preinstalled,
everything else will be installed from notebook itself.

Just copy `jupyter/train.ipynb` to service, update configs in notebook and run


### Charts

Both methods will print wandb url that shows graphs and weights updated in
realtime.  
I made a run based on this "saegl/dinora-chess/traindocs:v0" dataset.  
[wandb url](https://wandb.ai/saegl/dinora-chess/runs/ozs75vi1).  
It took 11 hours on Nvidia P100, exact config could be seen at `Overview >
Config`

![Train graph shows convergence](/docs/assets/train.png "Train Graph")
![Validation graph indicates overfitting](/docs/assets/validation.png "Validation
graph")

value_loss: MSE, value is a combination of Z and Q
policy_loss: Cross Entropy of predicted move and actually played move (1880
possible moves in any position)

Looking at train graph I see clear convergence: all losses decrease, accuracy
increases.  
Validation is more interesting because dataset is small (160k games) I was able
to make many epochs (7), after about 4th, policy_loss is increases.

![Example game without search](/docs/assets/example_game.png "Example game")

This is moves predicted without search

![handmade dataset](/docs/assets/handmade_dataset.png "Handmade dataset")

Handmade dataset is very small validation set (120 positions), annotated by stockfish and me and compared to current network.  

Both tables generated on each validation, so you could see progress made by
network


## Evaluation

Besides train/validation loss graphs, to measure actual strength of resulted
neural networks you need to run little minimatch against stockfish. Look at
`uv python -m elofish --help`

For this run I took `valid-state-8` and `valid-state-16` from [Artifacts tab](https://wandb.ai/saegl/dinora-chess/runs/ozs75vi1/artifacts) and placed them to `models/traindocs-valid-state-8.ckpt` and `models/traindocs-valid-state-16.ckpt` respectively.

To run stockfish minimatch with them, you need `stockfish` available in PATH and
configs like this

```jsonc
{
    "max_games": 200,
    "min_phi": 20.0,
    "min_mu": 1200,
    "teacher_player": {
        "class": "StockfishPlayer",
        "start_rating": {
            "phi": 10
        },
        "init": {
            "command": "stockfish",
            "options": {},
            "time_limit": 1.0
        }
    },
    "student_player": {
        "class": "UCIPlayer",
        "start_rating": {
            "mu": 2000,
            "phi": 350
        },
        "init": {
            "command": [
                "python",
                "-m",
                "dinora",
                "--searcher",
                "ext_mcts",
                "--model",
                "alphanet",
                "--device",
                "cuda",
                "--weights",
                "models/traindocs-valid-state-16.ckpt"
            ],
            "options": {},
            "time_limit": 1.0
        }
    }
}
```

That you could run with

```bash
uv run python -m elofish <config.json>
```

After running very short elofish session (10 minutes each). Elofish
evaluates both around 2390 and 2233.

[Full elofish reports with games/logs/configs are here](https://wandb.ai/saegl/dinora-chess/artifacts/dataset/train_reports/v0/files)


Note that this report is very rough, games against only one engine, just 15
games, but it is fast and ensures that engines works, at least. If you want more accurate results, run engine tournament in CuteChess.
