[Installation & Usage](/docs/installation_usage.md)
| [Training](/docs/training.md)

An alphazero-like chess engine. It uses 
pytorch ConvNet for position evaluation and Monte Carlo Tree Search for 
calculating best move.

### Features
- Alpazero-like chess engine
- Convolutional Neural network in pytorch
- Monte Carlo Tree search + Tree visualization tool
- Supervised learning from pgns with Stockfish evals annotation
- Supervised learning solely from game outcome (Without stockfish evals)
- Current dataset made from [lichess elite database](https://database.nikonoel.fr/)
- UCI interface: Play using GUI programs or online on [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/Dinora)
- Multi-backend architecture to swap search strategies (Simple MCTS, Extended
MCTS) and position evaluators (pytorch, onnx)

#### Work in progress
- MCTS with Virtual Loss to improve parallelization
- Reinforcement learning 
- More NN models (Smaller Convnet, Transformers)

## Status
Dinora supports standard chess variations and time controls, with or without increment. Initial testing suggests an approximate Elo rating of 2507 (±60 at 1+0 TC) against Stockfish capped with the UCI_Elo flag.

For testing, use the Elo evaluation tool found at `src/elofish`
```python -m elofish --help```

Dinora was also available as a [lichess bot](https://lichess.org/@/Dinora), but it is currently offline. However, its game history is still accessible.

### Example game

Dinora vs Stockfish 16.1 **capped with flag UCI_Elo 2412**
Time Control: 1+0

## Tree Visualization

Dinora provides a tool for visualizing the MCTS search tree

To generate new visualizations see
```python -m dinora treeviz --help```
